# THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS THE SOLUTIONS TO THE 0x0B-python-input_output PROJECT
<br>

* Task 0: Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout: <br>
	Prototype: def read_file(filename=""): <br>
	You must use the with statement <br>
	You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions. <br>
	You are not allowed to import any module <br>
	test case file: no test cases needed <br>
<br>

* Task 1: Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written: <br>
	Prototype: def write_file(filename="", text=""): <br>
	You must use the with statement <br>
	You don’t need to manage file permission exceptions. <br>
	Your function should create the file if doesn’t exist. <br>
	Your function should overwrite the content of the file if it already exists. <br>
	You are not allowed to import any module <br>
	test case file: no test cases needed <br>
<br>

* Task 2: Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added: <br>
	Prototype: def append_write(filename="", text=""): <br>
	If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created <br>
	You must use the with statement <br>
	You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions. <br>
	You are not allowed to import any module <br>
	test case file: no test cases needed <br>
<br>

* Task 3: Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string):
	Prototype: def to_json_string(my_obj): <br>
	You don’t need to manage exceptions if the object can’t be serialized. <br>
	test case file: no test cases needed <br>
<br>

* Task 4: Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string: <br>
	Prototype: def from_json_string(my_str): <br>
	You don’t need to manage exceptions if the JSON string doesn’t represent an object. <br>
	test case file: no test cases needed <br>
